## Shared Wallet Project using Solidity
This Smart Contracts project is from the Udemy course [Ethereum Blockchain Developer Bootcamp With Solidity (2022)](https://www.udemy.com/course/blockchain-developer/).

The goal of this project is to create a shared wallet using smart contracts which limits users withdrawls using allowances.

The development goals of this project are:
* Have an on-chain wallet smart contract.
* Users can deposit funds to the smart contract using a fallbacka function
* The contract can store these funds and let users withdraw again according to each user's allowance.
* Owner can give "allowance" to other, specific user-addresses.
* Restrict the functions to specific user-roles using modifiers.
* Use existing smart contracts libraries such as Open Zeppelin.
