## Shared Wallet Project using Solidity
This Smart Contracts project is from the Udemy course [Ethereum Blockchain Developer Bootcamp With Solidity (2022)](https://www.udemy.com/course/blockchain-developer/).

The goal of this project is to create a shared wallet using smart contracts which limits users withdrawls using allowances.

The development goals of this project are:
* Tokenization using OpenZeppelin Smart Contracts as fungible tokens (ERC20)
* Creation of erc20, crowdsale, kyc smart contracts
* Unit testing for the smart contracts
* Implementing front-end interaction with the smart contracts using React and web3
